HOW TO USE MY PROGRAM:

1) Open the connect4.exe file.
2) When the main manu prompts, you'll have three choices to make.
	-Game Mode: Choose your preferred type of gameplay (Connect 4, Connect 5...);
	-Number of rows: Select the number of rows you'd prefer;
	-Number of columns: Select the number of columns you'd prefer;
   Please be careful on these number as the program could be bugged if you select a big game mode and a board that is way too small.
3) The game is going to ask for user inputs. The board is numbered and the program asks for the input of either Player 1 or 2. Select the column in which you'd want to drop your piece.

WARNING:
NEVER input characters or strings, as the program will bug and create an infinite loop.

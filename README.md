This is my Algorithms and Data Structure Coursework, which is entirely based on C. I was asked to implement Connect 4 in C along with some extra features.
The board is resizable and the game mode can change with connect 5,  connect 6 and so on.
Read the readme.txt in order to understand how to use the program.
